# BeReal Test

1. I have used clean architecture and MVVM with jetpack compose in this exercise.
3. I have separated the clean architecture layers (ui, data and domain) by packages in this
   coding test. For large projects, It can be split into multiple gradle modules.
4. Dagger Hilt is used for dependency management.
5. Support dark and light theme.
6. Requires Android Studio Dolphin 2021.3.1 
7. [App demo](bereal_demo.mp4)

## Roadmap
1. Adding UI tests.
2. Adding complete unit test coverage. I have added unit tests sparingly only to demonstrate the
   approach.
